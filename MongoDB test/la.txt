Researchers from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and Imperial College London found that an extra cup of coffee every day would lengthen1 the life of a man by around three months and a woman by around one month on average.
 
It also shows that people who drank three or more cups of coffee per day would have a lower risk of all-cause death, such as respiratory disease, kidney and liver disease as well as stroke, than those who did not drink coffee.
 
The research, published in the journal the Annals of Internal Medicine, surveyed more than 520,000 people aged2 over 35 from 10 European Union countries.
 
However, skeptics said that it was impossible to validate3 the relationship between coffee and longevity4, because the study had too many variables between coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers, such as healthier lifestyles, more spending on healthcare and more effective socializing that benefited people's wellbeing.
